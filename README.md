# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Class 01 Lab 01 Comments 

How much time you spent on the lab: 
Today's lab was mostly just following along with the demo so to get it set up only took me about half an hour. <br>
I then spent another half-hour on trying to render some royalty free images I found of a goat and a reindeer. I used this [link](https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/javascript/how+to+add+image+in+react+js) to reference how to add an image to a react program and then spent a chunk of time fiddling with how to make it work using the "this.props" functionality.

### Lab 2 Comments 
* A question within the context of today’s lab assignment
  * I'm curious about the cards and modals to make the site more interactive, no specific question just eager to keep learning. 
* An observation about the lab assignment, or related ‘Ah-hah!’ moment
  * It took me a bit of time to get the title and description rendering, and I think my ah-hah was pretty simple in realizing that it was exactly the same way I got the images to render, kind of silly but felt good to get it working properly. 
* How long you spent working on this assignment
  * I spent about an hour working on this assignment overall. 


## Lab 3
In lieu of the Plagiarism talk this morning in lecture, I've been not adding a comment in my Readme to denote that I spend most of my time in lab with Ben and Tai, and we spend a lot of time bouncing ideas back and forth. 

Tai was able to help me with my gituation where my whole virtual machine was being treated as a github repo, they're the best really, very helpful.

Ben showed us this neat site for cool button animations so I'll give him credit too but the code is from this site linked above.

I added cards to my app and took some inspiration from Cole's code review today to add shadows :)
